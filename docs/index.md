# Welcome to Rome Bridge

Rome Bridge is an adapter between Feature Stores and Data Science Models.

It makes it so that there is a common interface to models and also eliminates the trouble (and risk) in feeding features into a data science model. Too frequently you will find yourself spending too much time rewriting the interface code. With this standard intefrace you can swithch out Feature Stores or Models without a lot of code changes.
