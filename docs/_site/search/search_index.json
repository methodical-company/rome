external site with a search get endpoint meaning one that endsin q lt term gt then you can automatically link page tags to search this endpoint for example on an hpc site i d want a tag like mpi to do a search on http ask cyberinfrastructure org for mpi see the tags section below for how to configure this discourse forumif you have a discourse forum that you want to show questions from there is an easy way to embed them here specifically there is an include include embed discourse html that is deployed at forum and added to the table of contents under extra gt discussion forum you can add this include to wherever you want the questions to appear the follow parameters are defined in the config yml discourse site https ask cyberinfrastructure org discourse per page 10discourse category stanford research computing discourse tags null comma separated string leave null to not filterfor the above we embed 10 topics from the stanford research computing category of askci and render 10 per page since there are few topics we don t filter down to tags if we did we should provide a list of comma separated values the page looks like this and is live here note that you aren t required to only embed one category you can easily modify the code to include more than one by copy pasting the d topics list infoto use this for your discourse site you must enable the embed topics setting documentationdocumentation pages should be written in the docs folder of the repository and you are allowed to use whatever level of nesting subfolders that works for you it s a jekyll collection which means that youcan add other content images scripts and it will be included for linking to organizationthe url that will render is based on the path for example if we had the following structure docs getting started md clusters sherlock getting started mdthe first page akin to the one you are reading would render at it s path docs getting started linkingfrom that page we could provide thedirect path in markdown to any subfolder to link to it such as the secondgetting started page for sherlock example clusters sherlock getting started md here is an example link to a relative path of a file example page md in the same directory and from that page you can test linking to a subfoldr in the case of not having a subfolder we could write the link out directly example site baseurl docs clusters sherlock getting started md or better there is a shortand trick we can use the provided includes template to do the same based on the path to create a link include doc html name sherlock cluster path clusters sherlock getting started the path should be relative to the docs folder headerswhile this is a personal preference it s recommended to create nesting of your docs via markdown sections in each of the filesover creating more files for example take a look at the rightside of this page and you ll see a level represented for each header this strategy means that we have fewer overall pages easier to find content that are still browsable easily via search or the table of contents on the right pagesthe pages folder uses the same page layout but is not part of the docs collection the two are provided to create a distinction between website pages e g about feed xml and documentation pages navigationwhether you place your page under pages or docs for those pages that you want added to the navigation you should add them to data toc yml if you ve defined a permalink in thefront end matter you can use that e g about below if you haven t andwant to link to docs the url is the path starting with the docs folder here is an example of a flat structure title getting started url docs getting started title about url about title news url news and here is an example with nested children currently active in the example title getting started url docs getting started children title features url docs getting started features title development url docs getting started development title customization url docs getting started customization title about url about title news url news if you want to add an external url for a parent or child do this title github repository external url https www github com vsoch mkdocs jekyllnews postsit might be the case that your site or group has news items that wouldwarrent sharing with the community and should be available as a feed for this reason you can write traditional posts in the postsfolder that will parse into the site feedthe bottom of the page links the user to a post archive where posts are organizedaccording to the year buttonsbuttons come in a nice array of colors here is the code for a basic example and you d want to vary the btn lt tag gt to get different classes lt button class btn btn success gt btn success lt button gt btn success btn info btn secondary btn primary btn danger btn warningbadgesfor news post items it s nice to be able to tag it with something that indicatesa status such as warning or alert for this reason you can add badges tothe front end matter of any post page and they will render colored by a type with the tag of your choice for example here is an
